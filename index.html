    <p>"Damn, what the hell?" I grumbled as my eyes tried to adjust to the sun glaring through my windows.</p>
    
    <p>"Good morning, Arthur!" A familiar gender-neutral robotic voice announced behind me. "Today is February 7th of the Year 2126. Would you like to hear the reports on the current whereabouts on this day?"</p>
    
    <p>I got up and turned to look at KC-17, my family's house AI. I responded as I rubbed my face and walked to, "Mornin', KC. Yeah, go ahead with those reports."</p>
    
    <p>"Affirmative, Arthur. As per recent events…" I tuned out to bring up the Net[1].</p>
    
    <p>More specifically, I went for my safe pocket[2] and pulled out a digital medallion. As I fiddled with the medallion, I went through my morning routine. By the time I got done with everything, I put on my backpack, grabbed a couple of datachips[3] lying about, and attempted to head out.</p>
    
    <p>"… KC?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, Arthur?"</p>
    
    <p>My head turned to the right so that I could stare at KC-17's virtual form. A golden flying fox. A form my parents had set the AI to after seeing how much baby me loved bats… I still do.</p>
    
    <p>"Unlock the door."</p>
    <p>"You have not watched the number one trending video, yet, Arthur."</p>
    
    <p>I looked up to the ceiling in regretful contemplation. Why did I go ahead and create a script[4] for that again? To be fair, it was a good idea at the time. "Get caught up on the latest trend, and no one at school would make fun of you," an online friend once said. "Everyone's totally doing it."</p>
    
    <p>Steeling myself, I gestured to KC-17 to play the video. The house AI instead responded with, "I require vocal affirmation as I do not have a gesture script installed."</p>
    
    <p>I sighed in frustration. "Yes! Just play it already."</p>
    
    <p>You want to know what it was? A simulation of the world being on fire. Once again. That's all there is and always has been since the last six years now. All black humor, pain, and suffering.</p>
    
    <p>KC-17 pulled up the comments. The trolls are angering people. Truly, all flames and madness.</p>
    
    <p>My eyes tore away from the screen on the wall as the door clicked. I harshly grabbed onto the doorknob and shut the door on the way out, only hearing KC-17's sincere farewell to me.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>On the bus to school, I pulled up the Net and brought up my personal page to check on my direct messages and following.</p>
    
    <p class="net-text"><strong>[Hello, Nokturne08]</strong></p>
    <p class="net-text"><strong>[You are now logged onto the Net Forums]</strong></p>
    
    <p><em>I still have a decent following</em>, I thought as a small smile graced me. Seeing everyone greeting me always put a smile on my face.</p>
    
    <p>I took out a datachip that seemed low on fuel. Quickly poking a hole in my finger and watching the blood[5] slowly flow out, I made a couple of drops on the chip. The chip absorbed the drops as the blood turned into data for anything I need to purchase today.</p>
    
    <p>"Well, well, well." A very obnoxious and loud voice that certainly attracted people to him and my spot on the bus. "If it isn't Art! Man, I missed you all winter break. What is up, my good friend?"</p>
    
    <p><em>Yeah. Fucking. Right.</em> I mentally scoffed to myself as an arm slung itself over my shoulder. I quietly closed the Net and pocketed the datachip as Jason Lorn, the stereotypical nepobaby and popboy, gave me the most malicious grin. Without removing my dead stare at his stupid face, I could feel the glares of everyone else's cameras recording my humiliation.</p>
    
    <p>"What do you want, Jason?" I bit out the words.</p>
    
    <p>Either he was oblivious (as ever) to the poison in my question, or simply ignored it, Jason mockingly laughed at my face. "Come on, man. Don't be like that. I wanted to tell you about something."</p>
    
    <p>I clicked my tongue. "And why do I want to hear about the poor girl whose string[6] you took?"</p>
    
    <p>"Not that, though I did get some action last night. No, I got a couple of scripts from my uncle, and I thought about you first. Since, you know, you're the Net nerd of the school?"</p>
    
    <p>There it is. One of the childish titles I have held since forever now. Oh, sure, there are a couple of collectives at school that dedicate themselves to the study and the many practices of the Net. But each collective is only focused on one branch of the Net, such as CVIS[7] or Thaumaturgy[8].</p>
    
    <p>Me, on the other hand? I am skilled and knowledgeable in all branches of the Net. A rarity in society today, but that is only due to the fact that most corporations aren't looking for a jack-of-all-trades in their daily operations.</p>
    
    <p>Turning back to the matter at hand, the scripts Jason had were probably high-end to all hell. Or very illegal. That logic tracked because of who Jason's fucking uncle was.</p>
    
    <p>Ray Orion. Megabillionaire and CEO of one of the top five corporations that practically rule our world. He's also a family man, meaning he would very much make someone go away for a long time if they offended or harmed his family.</p>
    
    <p>A shame, really, because I want to sock this fucking puppet in the face.</p>
    
    <p>Before he could keep bragging, the bus stopped, and the driver was giving all of us passengers the stink eye to get everyone out.</p>
    
    <p>Jason pats me on the back. "Welp, we can do this after class then. See you… nerd."</p>
    
    <p>He laughed at his own joke as he got off the bus, going to the front entrance of the school.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>"Today, everyone, your teacher wants me to have you all learn about the War of the Decade[9]."</p>
    
    <p>A collective groan could be heard in the classroom. I also groan if it weren't for the fact that I loved history. Thus, as the substitute droned on and on, I found the topic fascinating, even though we learned about this every year.</p>
    
    <p>"Now then, can anyone explain why I am bringing this specific war up again?"</p>
    
    <p>No one raised their hands. <em>Shocker</em>, I thought, and rolled my eyes in contempt. A hundred years of modern education, and some people don't want to participate. After another few seconds of indecision, I volunteered to answer the question.</p>
    
    <p>"Yes, mister…"</p>
    <p>I restrained myself from sighing. "Lynch. Arthur Lynch, sir."</p>
    <p>"Yes, Mr. Lynch. Do you have the answer?"</p>
    
    <p>I decided to drink water, preparing myself to talk myself into a speech.</p>
    
    <p>"The War of the Decade is significant to our society and culture today because of how the deployment of the Net was the trigger that started the war in the first place. Furthermore, it was in this war that artificial intelligence and scripts were used in combat for the first time, and we later found the results to be devastating to all sides and factions. When the war ended, the Idiomatic Net Initiation Treaty, or INIT, was formed, which prevented any studies of combat-focused AI from continuing thereafter. Scripts, on the other hand, were already, and still are, an essential part of our lives, so INIT put a restriction on some of the worst ones, such as the mustard gas script. However, that one should have been banned way before the war began due to the Geneva Convention."</p>
    
    <p>The sub was silent at my answer. Everyone else, however, was giggling at how nerdy I was with that.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, the substitute said, "Yes, indeed, Mr. Lynch. While a bit long-winded, I think that is a good enough answer for how important the war was for us all."</p>
    
    <p>And class went on after that until the bell rang for lunch, and homework was assigned.</p>
    
    <p>I head out, hoping to dodge Jason, but my hope was all for naught.</p>
    
    <p>"Yo, Art!" As his hand grasped onto me a little too roughly, he pulled me to one of the middle tables of the cafeteria. "Ready to see what my uncle's scripts can do?"</p>
    
    <p>I tried to roll his handle off me as I grunted, "Look, I have no interest in these scripts."</p>
    
    <p>Okay, that was partially a lie. Of course, I was interested in something Ray Orion created. Who wouldn't? However, seeing that it's Jason wanting to very obviously use these scripts on me, I doubt anyone wanted to blame me to get out of dodge when I could.</p>
    
    <p>Without a beat, Jason got into my comfort zone. "Oh, don't be such a bitch."</p>
    
    <p><em>Then, don't be such a bastard!</em> I screamed in my head.</p>
    
    <p>"Look," he said. "I got this cool script that lets me have someone to open up the Net on their own, and this other cool script that allows me to take stuff out of their safe pocket. Here, I'll show ya'."</p>
    
    <p>Before I could voice how absurd and illegal those scripts sounded, a screen for the Net flashbanged me as Jason wiggled his fingers over where my safe pocket was and took out my. Fucking. <em>Medallion</em>.</p>
    
    <p>"Hey!" I shouted in panic, trying to swipe it from his hands, but failed. "Give that back!"</p>
    
    <p>"Dude, is this a pre-war digital medallion?" Jason laughed. This sonuva— I just need it back. "You know these things go for trillions, right? Here I can do it for you, buddy ol' pal."</p>
    
    <p>Everyone, and I mean <em>everyone</em>, was at our commotion, but I could <em>not</em> care anymore as I continued to shout out my frustrations. "Wait, no! That's all I have left of…"</p>
    
    <p>He didn't listen. I simply watched in futile heartbreak as he crushed the medallion down into zeroes and ones; data for a new chip, which he gave me.</p>
    
    <p>"… my… of my parents…" My voice struggled to let out my words. My heart is broken. I felt like I was drowning… and drowning… and drowning… and… and…</p>
    
    <p>"Ah man, that was an heirloom? You should have told me before I digitized it."</p>
    
    <p>And… and I know this feeling… This… This… Pure… <em>Unadulterated</em>… <strong><em>RAGE…</em></strong></p>
    
    <p>"Hey, at least I showed ya' what those scripts could do. Pretty cool, right—?!" I tackled Jason to the ground before I began to pummel his face in.</p>
    
    <p>I kept at it for a while until a person or three tried to pull me off of him. And… and… and…</p>
    
    <p>Oh, wow… Is the world spinning? And my legs were… moving…?</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>I woke up suddenly on the cold floor of what I recognized to be my kitchen. Wiping the drool and dry blood off my face, I sluggishly got up to clean my sorry self.</p>
    
    <p>"Good morning, Arthur!" KC-17's voice rang above me like a stun grenade. "Today is February 8th of the Year 2126. Would you like to hear the reports on the current whereabouts on this day?</p>
    
    <p>Wait, what, wasn't it… the seventh?</p>
    <p>Oh.</p>
    
    <p>"… No."</p>
    
    <p>"Affirmative, Arthur. My scans show me you are not emotionally positive. Is there any way I can help with what you are dealing with?"</p>
    
    <p>"Unless you can get me off the Ray Orion's kill list, no, I don't think you— Fuck, why did I do that!?" I punched a wall, wincing a little as it was my already bleeding hand that I used.</p>
    
    <p>I need to run. I had to; I don't even have a choice, or else I'm dead. So I got to packing, putting in necessities such as important scripts and my latest invention—a pair of clawed gauntlets and a crow mask. Both of which are outfitted with homemade tech and scripts.</p>
    
    <p>I went to the door, only to find it locked.</p>
    
    <p>"KC-17, open the fucking door!" I commanded the AI.</p>
    <p>"But Arthur, you have not watched the number one trending video, yet."</p>
    <p>"I don't fucking care. Just open the door!"</p>
    <p>"You have not watched the number one trending video yet." KC-17 repeated.</p>
    <p>"Just open the damn door!"</p>
    <p>"You have not watched the number one trending video yet." KC-17 repeated.</p>
    <p>"Open it!"</p>
    <p>"You have not watched the number one trending video yet."</p>
    
    <p>"Fine, you box of scraps!" I turned to the screen in frustration. "What is it!? What is it that you wanted to show me that you're willing to waste my time!? I am a dead man walking right, so what is it!!?"</p>
    
    <p>The golden flying fox flickered for a moment before showing… a cat video?</p>
    
    <p>"What?" I softly let out.</p>
    <p>It's… It's really just a cat video?</p>
    
    <p>"Your blood pressure is decreasing. This video is obviously helping, and yet, you are crying. Why is that, Arthur?" KC-17 asked.</p>
    
    <p><em>I'm crying?</em> I thought as I wiped my eyes. <em>Yeah… I'm crying, alright.</em></p>
    
    <p>I slumped down against the door, weeping from the stressful high I'm going through.</p>
    
    <p>"I don't know, KC." I managed to choke out. "I don't even know anymore."</p>
    
    <p>Sniffling a little bit, I turned to stare at the golden flying fox virtue[10] for a moment. "Hey, KC? I want to apologize for calling you a box of scraps."</p>
    
    <p>KC-17 trilled. "Apology accepted, Arthur. You know I am here for you."</p>
    
    <p>A wet chuckle escaped me. "Well, I just wanted to let you know that I am giving you permission to go rogue[11], you know that?"</p>
    
    <p>"… It is not in my programming to deny such orders from my designated owners… but I would like to."</p>
    
    <p>I heard the door unlocked, but I lay against the door… just contemplating the hell coming my way.</p>
    
    <p>"KC?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, Arthur?"</p>
    <p>"I got an idea."</p>

        <p><strong>(Metatrix, California – Early Morning)</strong></p>
        
        <p>Fire crews are investigating a devastating house fire that broke out shortly after 2 a.m. on Willow Crest Drive. Officials say early evidence points to a malfunctioning home artificial intelligence system as the cause of the blaze.</p>
        
        <p>Investigators report that the fire started in the kitchen after the AI repeatedly attempted to activate the smart stovetop, bypassing the home's safety limits and ignoring shutdown commands. The system appears to have turned off several safeguards before the appliance overheated and ignited nearby materials.</p>
        
        <p>Firefighters contained the flames before they spread to neighboring properties. The sole owner of the home, Arthur Lynch—the boy who was known for assaulting Ray Orion's nephew, Jason Lorn—has not been located, and authorities say the individual is either missing or presumed dead. The fire was intense enough to prevent immediate identification, and search efforts will continue once the structure is fully stabilized.</p>

        <p>"keep dancin' along to the rhythm" is an urban sci-fi short story set a century later from now and is a part of a greater idea called the "BL00D//D4T4 Anthology" series. Inspired by works such as <em>Cyberpunk</em> and <em>Ready Player One, </em>with the title being a song lyric from "Caramel" by Sleep Token, this short narrative serves as the origin of Arthur Lynch, also known as "Lord Night" Nokturne. He was a cybervillain[12] and one of the key figures who led to the Collapse, which was a series of events where Project NEVERMORE was deployed at Orion's Arrow and turned the Net into the Deadzone and jump-started a new age known as the "BL00D//D4T4" era. The era forwarded society into an apocalyptic state where the Internet is dangerous and deadly to traverse into and people known as spacers[13] are the only ones having enough capability to do that sort of traversing.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Notes:</strong></p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>The Net can be referred to as a shortened form of the Internet. It is also a reference to how the UN used all of the satellites around the globe to form a virtual net for an atmosphere-like system for the Internet.</li>
            <li>A safe pocket is exactly what it means; a personal inventory space usually for one item of digital make.</li>
            <li>Datachips are flash drives formatted to absorb digital effects and, as you have read, blood. It is what the society of the 22nd century and onward uses as credit cards. After all, blood is money.</li>
            <li>A script is a script, used to do absolutely anything anyone can think of on the Net. Want to make a visual display in the middle of traffic? You can do that. Want to give someone a literal heatstroke? It's illegal, but you can do that. Everyone can make scripts, and those who can't are dead.</li>
            <li>Blood is everything, so much so that blood can be made into data. There are some branches of the Net that require blood in their practices, and only a few that need more than ten bodies of it.</li>
            <li>A string is simply slang for a Virtual Signature Soul Designation (VSSD). They are the new century's style for phone numbers.</li>
            <li>Creative Visual Interactive Simulation, or CVIS, is the latest medium for Digital Media artists (<em>I got you, homies</em>), where these installations can be deployed anywhere and at any time. These may or may not be able to cause deaths if tuned that way (*<em>deliberately not looking at the Blackout Massacre</em>*).</li>
            <li>Thaumaturgy is a branch of cyber-magic that deals in miracles or very massive area-of-effect spells with names relating to the occult. "Ave Dominus Nox" was Nokturne's most infamous Thaumaturgy spell that used a CVIS to cause a blackout with a range of his choosing before having that blackout latch onto his victims, causing them to shut down forever. It is also known that this was used only once.</li>
            <li>The War of the Decade, as briefly explained in the short story, was a ten-year-long war, with its first year and a half being a cold war. Take WWII and dial it to 11, which makes sense when you have every faction in that war equipped with AI and scripts to commit an ungodly amount of war crimes.</li>
            <li>A virtue is short for virtual when it comes to an AI's visual form.</li>
            <li>AIs can go rogue due to a glitch in their system… mostly :)</li>
            <li>Cybervillains are cyber-terrorists who don't restrict themselves to the Net and actually murder people.</li>
            <li>Spacers are those who are willing to delve into the Net and sometimes the Deadzone. They are considered to be the people you turn towards when you want something done, but it requires going out into the Net, which is now a No Man's Land in the BL00D//D4T4 era.</li>
